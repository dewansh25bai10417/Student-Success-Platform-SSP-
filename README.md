# Student-Success-Platform-SSP-
Student Record Management System (SRMS) 🎓

A Python-based CLI tool designed to automate student grade calculations and record organization.

📌 Overview

The Problem: Manual student administration is tedious and error-prone. Calculating grades by hand leads to calculation mistakes, and retrieving specific student records from physical paper stacks is inefficient.

The Solution: This SRMS is a command-line interface tool that automates the math and organization. It allows for instant data entry, automated grade calculation based on score logic, and formatted reporting.

Context: This project was built to meet the requirements of CPL 101, demonstrating mastery of Python's core memory structures (Lists and Dictionaries) without relying on external databases.

🚀 Features

📝 Dynamic Record Entry: Input student details (Roll No, Name) and marks for multiple subjects effortlessly.

🧠 Smart Grading Algorithm: Automated logic that maps numerical scores to Letter Grades instantly (e.g., 90 → 'A').

🔍 Instant Search: Retrieve a specific student's full academic record by simply entering their Roll Number.

📊 Professional Table View: Generates a clean, column-aligned marksheet directly in the console/terminal.
